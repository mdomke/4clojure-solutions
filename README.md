4clojure-solutions
==================

These are my solutions for the execises on http://4clojure.com. 4Clojure is a good resource to learn Clojure and to get
familiar with the various functions included in the core namespace. The site itself also provides the ability to check 
the solutions of other users, but only after you have entered some code that passes the unit tests of the exercise. So
if you don't have a clue how to address a certain problem, this might be a source of inspiration.
